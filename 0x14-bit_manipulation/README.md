0x13. C - Bit manipulation

Bit manipulation is manipulating data that's smaller than a byte, henceforth the name bit manipulation. Bit manipulation is faster than complex arithmetic operations like division and multiplication. So, bit manipulation is desireable for more efficient/faster code. Because of the power of modern computing, most programs don't need to rely on bit maniuplation but in some cases, it is better. Cases like compression algorithms like huffman coding. There is also a common special case of storing 8 bool variables into one byte, like unix file permissions and CPU flags.
